# GenericUtilityLibrary

This TypeScript utility library offers a collection of generic functions designed for effective array and object manipulation, demonstrating the robustness and type safety of TypeScript generics. The library includes functions such as an identity function that preserves type information, an array reversal function, an object mapping function to transform values while keeping keys intact, and a filtering function to refine arrays based on custom conditions.

To get started, ensure you have Node.js installed, then clone the repository, navigate to the directory, and install the necessary dependencies. You can compile the TypeScript code with npx tsc and verify functionality through npm test.
